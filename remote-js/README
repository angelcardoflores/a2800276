GATHERING EVENTS ON THE CLIENT

Mouse events are gathered on the client using the `onmousemove`,
`onmousedown` and `onmouseup` events of the `window` object.

While every `move` event doesn't necessarily need to be gathered, i.e.
it would be permissible to skip every n'th event for optimization,
`click` events have a not redundancy and can't be ignore.

GATHERING GEOMETRY OF THE CLIENT

The geometry of the client's canvas (in this context, the canvas is the
page as rendered in the browser window) is gathered from the `offset...`
properties of DOM Node objects. While the offset... properties aren't
part of the DOM Specification, all major browsers seem to support them.


SENDING EVENTS TO THE SERVER

After a configurable number of mouse events are recorded, they are
transmitted to the server.

packet: seq num_events time event*
event: type d_time x y


SENDING GEOMETRY TO THE SERVER

The gathered geometry is serialized and sent to the server using XML-RPC.
