ANTVIS - Simple command line tool to generate graph of dependancies in
ant build scripts.

Requirements:

* Graphviz (http://www.graphviz.org/)

Building:

Just type `ant` in the same directory that this file is located in.
In order to build the actual runnable application, type `ant jar`.

Running:

* Create the runnable application Jar by typing `ant jar` in the
  directory that this file is located in.

* This creates `lib/antvis.jar` which you can run by typing:

	$ java -jar lib/antvis.jar

* Just running `java -jar lib/antvis.jar` produces the following usage
  information:

age: [jre] antvis.AntVis -f inputFile [-t format] [-o outfile]
        format: format supported by dot. Default: `dot`
        outfile: Default stdout
call [jre] antvis.AntVis -l for a list of supported formats


* So for example calling:

	$ java -jar lib/antvis.jar -f test.xml -t gif -o test.gif

  Would generate a GIF out of the provided ant script (test.xml).
